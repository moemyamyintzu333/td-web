# Feature Specification: Simple Todo-List Web Application

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-a-very`  
**Created**: 2025-09-21  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build a very simple todo-list web"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature: Simple web-based todo list application
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: End users; Actions: create, read, update, delete todos; Data: todo items; Constraints: simple interface
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: User authentication requirements]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Data persistence requirements - local storage vs server]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Multi-user support or single-user]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary flow: Add, view, complete, delete todos
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Basic CRUD operations for todo items
   ‚Üí Simple web interface
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Todo Item entity identified
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties about authentication and data persistence"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning with clarifications needed)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user visits the todo-list web application to manage their daily tasks. They can add new todo items with descriptive text, view their current list of todos, mark items as complete when finished, and remove items they no longer need. The interface should be clean and intuitive, allowing quick task management without complexity.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an empty todo list, **When** user adds a new todo with text "Buy groceries", **Then** the todo appears in the list as incomplete
2. **Given** a todo list with items, **When** user clicks on a todo item, **Then** the item is marked as complete and visually distinguished
3. **Given** a todo list with items, **When** user clicks delete on a todo, **Then** the item is removed from the list
4. **Given** a todo list with completed and incomplete items, **When** user views the list, **Then** all items are visible with clear status indication

### Edge Cases
- What happens when user tries to add an empty todo item?
- How does system handle very long todo text?
- What happens when user refreshes the page - are todos preserved?
- How does system behave with many todo items (100+)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to add new todo items with descriptive text
- **FR-002**: System MUST display all todo items in a readable list format
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to mark todo items as complete/incomplete
- **FR-004**: Users MUST be able to delete todo items from the list
- **FR-005**: System MUST distinguish visually between completed and incomplete todos
- **FR-006**: System MUST validate that todo text is not empty before adding
- **FR-007**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: data persistence - local storage, session storage, or server-side database?]
- **FR-008**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: user authentication required or anonymous usage allowed?]

### Non-Functional Requirements *(include as applicable)*
- **NFR-001**: Performance MUST meet page load ‚â§2s, user interactions ‚â§500ms response time
- **NFR-002**: User interface MUST be responsive on mobile devices 375px+ and desktop
- **NFR-003**: User interface MUST follow accessibility standards for keyboard navigation and screen readers
- **NFR-004**: Error handling MUST provide clear, actionable messages for invalid operations
- **NFR-005**: System MUST be usable without JavaScript (progressive enhancement) [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: JavaScript requirement level]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Todo Item**: Represents a single task with text description, completion status (boolean), creation timestamp, and unique identifier
