# Implementation Plan: Simple Todo-List Web Application

**Branch**: `001-build-a-very` | **Date**: 2025-09-21 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/Users/moemyamyintzu/td-web/specs/001-build-a-very/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Simple web-based todo list application allowing users to add, view, complete, and delete todo items. Built with Vite, vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and local SQLite database for minimal complexity while meeting constitutional performance and quality standards.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: JavaScript ES2020+ with Vite 4.x for build tooling  
**Primary Dependencies**: Vite (build), SQLite3 (storage), minimal additional libraries  
**Storage**: Local SQLite database for todo metadata and persistence  
**Testing**: Vitest for unit testing, Playwright for integration testing  
**Target Platform**: Modern web browsers (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+)
**Project Type**: web - determines frontend+backend structure  
**Performance Goals**: Page load ≤2s, user interactions ≤500ms response time  
**Constraints**: Minimal dependencies, vanilla JS preferred, no image uploads  
**Scale/Scope**: Single-user application, ~1000 todo items maximum expected

```

**Structure Decision**: Option 2 (Web application) - Frontend handles UI with vanilla JS, backend provides SQLite API endpoints

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh copilot` for your AI assistant
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (data-model.md, contracts/api-todos.md, quickstart.md)
- API contract (api-todos.md) → 4 contract test tasks [P] (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Todo entity → model creation and service tasks [P]
- Quickstart scenarios → 5 integration test tasks covering user journeys
- Implementation tasks: frontend components, backend API, database setup

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Contract tests → Integration tests → Implementation
- Dependency order: Database setup → Models → Services → API → Frontend
- Mark [P] for parallel execution where files are independent
- Frontend and backend tasks can be largely parallel after contracts

**Specific Task Categories**:
1. **Setup**: Vite config, Node.js/Express setup, SQLite database, ESLint/Prettier
2. **Database**: Schema creation, migration scripts, connection setup
3. **Backend Tests**: API contract tests, model tests, service tests
4. **Frontend Tests**: Component tests, integration tests for user scenarios
5. **Backend Implementation**: Todo model, API routes, database service
6. **Frontend Implementation**: UI components, API client, event handlers
7. **Integration**: CORS setup, error handling, performance optimization
8. **Polish**: Code quality, documentation, performance validation

**Estimated Output**: ~30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |


## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
