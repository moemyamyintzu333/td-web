# TD-Web Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality
All code MUST meet production standards before merging. Code MUST be readable, 
maintainable, and follow established patterns. Static analysis tools MUST pass 
without warnings. Code reviews MUST verify adherence to style guides and architectural 
decisions. No "quick fixes" or temporary code in main branches.

### II. Testing Standards (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Test-Driven Development MUST be followed: write failing tests before implementation. 
All features MUST have unit tests with ≥80% coverage. Integration tests MUST cover 
critical user paths. Contract tests MUST validate API boundaries. Performance tests 
MUST verify response time requirements. All tests MUST pass before deployment.

### III. User Experience Consistency
User interfaces MUST follow established design patterns and accessibility standards. 
Loading states, error messages, and user feedback MUST be consistent across the 
application. Mobile responsiveness MUST be verified on target devices. User interactions 
MUST be intuitive and follow platform conventions.

### IV. Performance Requirements
Frontend pages MUST load within 2 seconds on average devices. API responses MUST 
complete within 500ms for standard operations. Database queries MUST be optimized 
and indexed appropriately. Resource usage MUST be monitored and alerts configured 
for degradation. Performance regression tests MUST be included in CI/CD pipeline.

## Development Standards

Code MUST follow language-specific best practices and security guidelines. 
Dependencies MUST be kept up-to-date and security-scanned. Environment configurations 
MUST be managed through proper configuration management. Logging MUST be structured 
and include correlation IDs for request tracing. Error handling MUST be comprehensive 
with appropriate user-facing messages.

## Quality Gates

All pull requests MUST pass automated testing, security scans, and code quality checks. 
Peer review MUST verify business logic correctness and architectural alignment. 
Deployment MUST include smoke tests and rollback procedures. Production monitoring 
MUST verify system health post-deployment.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices and guidelines. 
All feature development MUST comply with these principles before merging to main. 
Amendments require team consensus and impact assessment on existing processes. 
Exceptions require explicit justification and technical lead approval.
